# OCAT - One Cell At A Time
OCAT provides a fast and memory-efficient framework for large-scale scRNA-seq data. 

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Method
OCAT constructs sparse representation of cell features through ghost cells in the datasets. These ghost cells serve as bridges to inform on cell-cell similarity between the original cells. With the sparse features extracted, OCAT provides an efficient framework for cell type clustering and dataset integration that achieves state-of-the-art performance.
